### How to add Navbar Links

The links in the navbar are automatically populated by Javascript.  You can add a new section with a `data-nav` tag set to the name you want displayed in the link. Illustrated below...

`<section data-nav="passion">`


### Active States

The background color changes when a user is in the active section, there are also animations that occur. These animations are input into the css using the `.active` css class as a selector.
